 * Implementation details
 *************************/

/* 
 * This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
 * results. 

 * You are required to provide a good README document including the
 * implementation details. In particular, you can use pseudocode to describe your
 * implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
 * copy/paste your C code. Rather, describe the evaluation choices you made in
 * the design of your heap manager.  For example, it should contain about the
 * list of information you store in the metadata structure, how the coalesce,
 * free, and split operations benefited from the metadata structure, the space
 * and time overheads and tradeoffs, the results of your test cases, the amount
 * of time you spend on the lab, your name and any collaborators involved,
 * references to any additional resources used, and your feedback on the lab).

 * We expect the design and implementation details to be at most 1-2 pages.  A
 * plain textfile is encouraged. However, a pdf is acceptable. No other forms
 * are permitted.

 * In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide the
 * details to maximize your partial credit.
